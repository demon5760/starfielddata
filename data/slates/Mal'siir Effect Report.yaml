  The effect is brief, but you would think it lasted days. Though it is
  intense, it provides a sense of understanding.

  The sensation itself is deeply unsettling and isn't euphoric at all, but
  leaves one feeling insightful and in awe. My memory of what exactly I
  encountered is vague and clouded, but the presence of a powerful
  entity lingers with me.

  Though the experience was rewarding, I would not describe it as
  positive. It would be difficult for me to abuse this as it leaves me with an
  immense feeling of discomfort.
