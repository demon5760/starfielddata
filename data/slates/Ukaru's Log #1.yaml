  So the coordinates on the tracking device brought me to what looks like
  a supply depot.

  Lucky for me, it doesn't seem as if anyone's home. Hello? Hello! Okay,
  looks clear.

  Anyway, the main entrance was locked but I managed to sneak my way
  into a vent area and into what looks like a security office.

  But there's too many crates, and some have been emptied out. I need
  override the computer, look at the manifest and ping the tracking device
  I placed on the crates.

  I wonder if I can even hack into the security system and identify their
  exact locations.
