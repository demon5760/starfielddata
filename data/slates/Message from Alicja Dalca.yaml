  For the past few days, I've been keeping an eye on a pair of bladed
  backs that have been wandering closer and closer to my farm, probably
  looking to expand their territory.

  This morning when I didn't spot them, I went out for a look. They were
  both dead, and I don't know why. There were no wounds on either of
  them.

  Yesterday, they seem liked two healthy young adults with no symptoms
  of any kind, and today, dead.

  It's exactly like the groats I mentioned in my last message. And it's not
  just here. You know Fihran Nostal, who travels around and repairs our
  machines? He said he found the body of a nautilus that seemd to have
  just dropped from the sky and died, again with no visible wounds or
  injuries.

  This isn't normal. Something is happening and I don't know what. I hope
  this information helps you to figure out what's going on.
