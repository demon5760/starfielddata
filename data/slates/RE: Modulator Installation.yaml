  To All Personnel:

  As per orders from the supervisor downstairs, the new Modulator has
  been installed. Rest assured that all necessary precautions have been
  taken, and it will pose no interference in the day-to-day operations of
  the facility.

  As with all operations downstairs, the exact nature and function of the
  Modulator is not your concern.

  Do not stand directly under the Modulator. Avoid prolonged exposure.

  The Modulator contains an energy core which, if exposed, should not be
  touched, inhaled, or looked at.

  Do not attempt to interact with the Modulator for any reason.

  In the event of an anomalous incident, report to your immediate
  supervisor immediately and then exit the facility.
