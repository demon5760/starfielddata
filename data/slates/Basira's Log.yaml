  Great Serpent,

  There are so few of us left, And while I have spent my entire life in
  devotion to You, I find myself afraid of death, of what is to come.
  Perhaps we are the clich&ecirc;, delving too deep into things better left
  unknown, paying the price for trying to glimpse too much.

  Forgive us our curiosity, our selfishness, our pride. We only wished to 
  truly find You, but it seems we still meet in the traditional way, in
  death.
