  Having halted the Serpent's Crusade to cavort with the Accursed, Jandar
  questioned his brother's choice. While he did not wish to betray his own
  brother, he also could not betray the will of the Great Serpent. And so
  he stood before the High Council and let his intentions be known. He
  would lay claim to the throne that was rightfully his, for the sake of the
  Shrouding.

  Only House Ma'leen displayed the courage to back Jandar's claim, his
  new bride having resided in the same house. In his cowardice, Jarek
  exiled Jandar and the entirety of House Ma'leen, in favor of maintaining
  his uneasy peace with the outsiders.

  Yet, rather than drift into the shadows of silence, Jandar vowed to honor
  the wishes of his father and continue the Serpent's Crusade.
