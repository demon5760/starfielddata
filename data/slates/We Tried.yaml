  It's finally happening. In a few days, a ship will come to take me home.
  They told me to lock the doors before I go, but what's the point? We're
  never coming back here.

  Since I have a little time to kill before closing up shop, I figured I'd write
  down the story of the most unique Chunks location ever. Why? It's
  something to do. And who knows, maybe someday House Va'ruun will
  open up their society and welcome visitors to their planet. Someone will
  stumble across this place and wonder how in the hell Chunks managed
  to pull it off.

  Yeah, right.

  I wasn't in the room when the deal was made, but I know some of the
  terms. The location wouldn't be allowed in the city, and the company had
  to keep the planet's existence a very-closely-guarded secret. I guess
  some hotshot exec was trying to make a name for himself by
  establishing the most remarkable locationin Chunks history. And to be
  fair, it really was. We had no outside competition here.

  As for me? I'm the fool who was cocky enough to think I could make this
  place work. And I was very, very wrong.

  We had issues almost from the start. It seemed like half the people came
  just to let me know how much they didn't want this place to be here, and
  thought their Great Serpent would frown upon any sign of embracing it.
  The way these people think is totally foreign to me.

  Getting supplies was a nightmare. In order to preserve the secrecy of
  the planet's location, the company employed a long, roundabout chain
  of third-party merchants. Even something as simple as replacing a chair
  for the dining room could take weeks, or even months.

  When it was clear that sales were way below targets, I tried to hire a
  couple of locals. My thinking was, it might serve as a bridge to make
  people feel less wary of coming in. All that did was drain the proverbial
  coffers even faster.

  The corporate marketing team tried to come up with ideas for
  promotions, but they ranged from laughable ("Groatfest"? Really?) to
  heretical (Get a discount if you dress up like the Great Serpent! Were
  they TRYING to get me killed?)

  The original plan had been to give it five years, at least. But things
  started to change around here, and not in a good way. People started
  carrying weapons pretty much all the time. I heard stories about martial
  drills and fiery speeches in Jinan Plaza. I was getting a lot of dirty looks,
  more than usual.

  I sent message after message asking for an extraction, and finally the
  top brass agreed it was time to end the experiment. I don't think I've
  ever felt so relieved.

  So what have I learned? That the people of of House Va'ruun scare the hell
  out of me, basically. And that sometimes, our reach exceeds our grasp
  here at Chunks.

  Probably best if we stick to what we know.

  Guess I'll wrap it up here. Part of me can't help but wonder what'll
  become of this place. I like to think some herd of wild groats will move in.
  Then it'll really be a groatfest.
