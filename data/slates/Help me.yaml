  Great Serpent, please help me, I beg of you. I do not know what to do. It has been been weeks
  with no income. My savings are all but gone -- soon I will have to resort to begging for
  scraps.

  My wife and son resent me from weeks of telling them "no".

  No, we cannot eat today.

  No, we cannot heat our home.

  No, we cannot move outside the city.

  We cannot do anything -- no, I cannot do anything. I feel so worthless, weak.. perhaps my
  family would be better off without me.
