  First entry of the first day of my new life. I hope.

  I suppose I'm a groat farmer now. A long way from heir apparent, but I am
  thankful for the distance. Yes, quite a bit has happened since last I
  write.

  Tane never came, and I had to flee when Vortex Horrors found me and
  attacked. Perhaps I have my father of all people to thank for those
  combat lessons he forced me through.

  Some kind farmers took me in and helped patch me up. They were
  respectful of my privacy and even pointed me here after telling them a
  version of my plight. Should my father send anyone after me, I can only
  hope my remaining anonymous keeps them safe.
