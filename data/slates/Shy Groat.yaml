  I've been watching the Groat for weeks now, and they still aren't
  reproducing. I've done everything right - good space, right temperature,
  and proper food. They seem healthy and active, but no babies yet. I'm
  not sure what's wrong. Maybe I'm missing something or these Groats are
  different somehow. Need to ask an expert.

  I'm thinking of giving them a candlelight dinner to see if that does the
  trick.
