  Wind Turbines continue to ice up. They're the originals, and this being
  New Homestead and all, it seems fitting to keep them that way.
  Recommendation is to keep administering repairs. Replacing them, while
  sensible, is both costly and diminishes the classic appeal of New 
  Homestead. As such, I will decline sending a proposal to the
  appropriate parties at the UC Energy Dept.
