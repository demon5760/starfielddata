  Is this really how I go out? I knew we should have never tried to strike
  out into unknown space like this. But the crew were ready to mutiny if
  we didn't try for it. Now here we are slowly be pulled into an uncharted
  planet in the middle of a system not on anyone's charts. Well.... anyone
  but the Va'ruun apparently. Four ships appeared out of nowhere as
  soon as we arrived at this strange planet. We had no chance and they
  knew it. No communication, just opened fire. Looks like that last minute
  maneuvering lost them, but our engines gave out right after. Now all we
  can do is wait for gravity to do its thing.
