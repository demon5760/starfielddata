  I do not know what to do with myself. I have hated you so much for so long, and now that
  you are gone I fear I may go insane.

  The Great Serpent taking you before I could kill you myself is a slap in the face that I will
  never recover from.

  I curse your spirit, and will never forgive you for what you have done to me. I hope that
  wherever you are, it is painful.
