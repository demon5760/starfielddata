  Everyone,

  On more than one occasion, seemingly healthy animals have been dying,
  and with no obvious cause. Please keep a close eye on your groats.
  Look for any sign of unusual behavior or illness. If you see something
  unusual, let me know right away.

  I sent a message to Azad Dubas at Hamadi Station in the hope that he
  and he his wife can look into the matter. Serpent willing, they will solve
  this mystery quickly.
