  That Fateful Day \
  A poem by Sherine Dubas \
  WORK IN PROGRESS! \
  (That means NO comments from you, dear, not until it's ready!)

  The gusts that howl in canyons deep \
  Are the Serpent's hissing voice. \
  He tells us of that fateful day \
  The time will come, \
  We'll stand as one, \
  And the chosen shall rejoice.

  Until that time, we heed the call \
  To serve Him how we may \
  That all shall be found worthy \
  Our voices raised \
  His name be praised \
  Upon that fateful day
