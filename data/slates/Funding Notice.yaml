message: |
  Herald Inaza has brought to my attention a disturbing matter. There has
  been discussion of eliminating the funding to maintain and preserve the
  Serpent's Pathin the latest proposed budget. I find this surprising,
  given the paltry amount requested and the significance of the location.

  It should be enough that the cave is a key peice of our shared heritage.
  Were it not for those caves, none of us would be here today.

  But, if all goes to plan in the coming months, we may be able to thank
  the Great Serpent himself for a new wave of recruits to our cause. The
  Serpent's Path may yet againbe needed for its original purpose.

  I am confident that the Council will make the right decision. And if the
  funding cannot be secured, Il would be more than happy to personally
  take a closer look at the budget to see what areas might be trimmed in
  order to free up funds.
