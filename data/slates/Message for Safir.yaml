  Safir,

  Sidari's group hit a tomb and grabbed some old gear. None of the stuff
  works but the boss likes the spacesuit. Says it looks "fierce."

  He wants to hang on to the rest to give out as trophies, but I don't know
  what's the point of a gun that don't shoot. He says it's okay to try and
  fix the gear so long we don't break anything.

  See what you can do with it, but don't damage anything, or you're
  definitely not ever leaving this place.
