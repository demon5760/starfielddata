sub_title: The True Word of Jinan Va'ruun Volume 1
green_light: false
message: |
  It is known that Jinan Va'ruun took the word of the Great Serpent and
  gave it breath. That under his guidance the ship of the dawn became
  the flagship of of Mourning, and that all would be made Penitent through
  the holy Serpent's Crusade.

  Yet when his son, Jarek, stole the crown which was rightfully Jandar's, he
  ended the holy war and defied the Great Serpent.

  His blasphemy sent the true believers into exile, and delayed the time of
  the Shrouding until the Promised were restored.
