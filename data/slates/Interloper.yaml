  The comptuers are glitching again. Switching to old-fashioned notes.

  I heard something in the vents when I was doing my maintenance
  routine in the mainframe room.

  I think we got us an interloper from XL-069.

  Please, could you have a look? Get a weapon from the captain and see
  what you can find.
