  In time, Jandar amassed an army of the devout, growing House Ma'leen
  into a force on par with the colonies of the Settled Systems. He
  organized attacks into civilized space, and dispensed the gospel of Jinan
  to all who would listen.

  Apostates and Accursed alike heard the true word, blessed by the
  Serpent's tongue, and pledged loyalty to Jandar's cause.

  But Jarek, in his final betrayal, deemed the Promised to be zealots, and
  so this lie became the word spoken by the damned.
