  I am writing this in what may be my final moments because Basira
  thought it might ease my mind, but I believe that is an impossibility given
  the circumstances. After arguing with for longer than I would like to
  admit, her I am, writing regardless.

  I believe I have come to accept my impending death. Perhaps my greater
  faith in the Great Serpent allows for this. My colleague, Emerson, has
  succumbed to his weakness and retreated to Crew Quarters. You would
  think our Chief of Engineering would have a greater resolve. It is a good
  thing I am no Warden, only a lowly scientist.

  Unlike many, I have no friends or family that will miss me and the feeling
  is mutual. My one regrest is not having the chance to complete the Path
  of Redemption one last time.

  Now that I have written some, I know for a fact that I feel no better. I will,
  however, take great pleasure in telling Basira she was wrong.
