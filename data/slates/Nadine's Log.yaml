  As I write this, there are three of us left: Sirak, Basira, and myself. We
  have all accepted the inevitable, that either we're destined to fall victim
  to these "Vortex Phantoms," as Sirak calls them, or we're destined to
  become them. I pray it's the latter. One final step into the Unknown. The
  mortal aspect of me fears the change, but the scientific aspect hopes to
  embrace it.

  To my fellow scientists and loved ones: do not mourn me. Know that I've
  bore witness to unimaginable things here. My only regret is not having
  the tools to properly study them But as I said, Death is upon me, and all
  mysteries are soon to be solved.
