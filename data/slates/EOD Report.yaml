  EOD Report \
  \----------------------------

  \- Looking into moving to the opposite side of the road. Scarce minerals
  currently available. \
  \- We are going not need some more explosives if we want to meet
  deadlines. \
  \- Need a crew to survey rock stability. Due to explosions, my men have
  heard some noises that cause concern and caution.
