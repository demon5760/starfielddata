  Everyone,

  This place is ours and nobody's going to take it from us. You see any of
  these House Va'ruun freaks trying to get in, you waste them quick. Same
  goes for any from the Fleet tha ain't us. You really think Delgado's crew
  ain't going to try to take this operation over if they find out about it?

  Trust nobody, and I mean NOBODY. Kill on sight anyone that ain't in our
  crew. That's the only way we're going to hold on to this operation. Don't
  get lazy, or you'll be made an example.

  Spread the word.
