  Children of Jandar,

  Our time sits on the crest of a great wave, and it will come crashing into
  the sons and daughters of Jarek in their moment of weakness. For now, 
  let the waters gather and ripple the hymns of the Great Serpent, in the
  belly of Jandar's Rest. The coordinates embedded on this slate will point
  the way. 

  If you heed the call, come join our communion. When the Hymn is
  spoken, tell them your name is Promised.
