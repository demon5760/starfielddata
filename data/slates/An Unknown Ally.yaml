  Today Michael introduced us to our newest weapon against the heretics.
  They are called the Redeemed, but it remains to be seen how they live
  up to their name.

  Truly the Redeemed are a weapon. A force to be reckoned with, but is
  such a fate one of great honor or punishment? The fight and speak
  with a fervor we share, but while ours comes from a place of passionand
  conviction, theirs comes from somewhere primal. It is both all they known
  and all they have.
