  Revenue is down once again. Unsurprising, given the state of emergency.
  But, the Great Serpent still provides to his faithful, and has provided me the means to
  keep my head above water.

  The vagrants in the city frequently come by to pawn their items - most of which are stolen,
  but I do not ask questions. When they inevitably default on their loan, I am able to resell
  the item for a good price.
