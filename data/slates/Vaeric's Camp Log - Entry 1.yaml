  I've done it. I've left. My father is furious. I've never seen him so angry. I 
  always figured he knew this day was coming, but perhaps he's just that 
  delusional. This proves he'd never see things my way, that I made the
  right decision, but my mind still bombards me with questions.

  Did I act too quickly? What about Vitoria and Luther? What about Eggie
  and Bee? What will my father do now?

  My only hope for sleep at this point is that the exhaustion will simply
  take me.
