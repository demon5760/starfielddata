  The contact in Dazra has made assurances that Jandar's Rest will
  remain hidden, and that the one name Qisrani Dul'kehf will be handled.

  But we have trusted the Children of Jarek before and they abandoned
  the Great Serpent in their cowardice.

  Now an outsider has entered our home only moments after he assured
  us we are in no danger.

  If we die here, let it be known that Mujeen Ka'dic is the betrayer.
