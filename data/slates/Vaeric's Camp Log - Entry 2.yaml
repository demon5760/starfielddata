  As expected, I didn't sleep well last night. At least this morning I can
  turn to my camp and think of what to do next.

  Planning ahead certainly paid off. I've been slowly building up this area
  ever since Tane and I first discussed plans to get me off Va'ruun'kai. I
  figured I'd need a safe place if I had to leave unexpectedly and lay low.

  I have the tracking device he gave me, so I can only hope he puts two
  and two together. In the meantime, I'm hoping to distract my mind by 
  organizing my new temporary home here. Who knows how long it might be
  before Tane finds me.
