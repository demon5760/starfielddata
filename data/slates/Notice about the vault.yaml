  Now that we got a nice little stockpile. I'm putting Jaxon in charge of the
  vault. He's the only one who puts anything in or takes anything out.
  Anyone who tries to go past Jaxon gets a slug between the eyes.

  Spread the word. Best if nobody goes near the vault, in case intentions
  get mistaken.
