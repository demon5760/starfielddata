  Five years ago today I lost you, and yet you still visit me in my dreams
  every anniversary. Do you truly love me so much? I doubt I am worth
  going through the trouble.

  It was wonderful to see you again, darling. To hug you, feel your warmth,
  smell you, taste your lips. To see your smile, your beautiful smile, that I
  thought I would be deprived of forever.

  But then I woke up.

  I am afraid I must ask a cruel thing of you. Please, darling, you must
  stop visiting me. I am not strong enough to handle the heartbreak of
  waking from these perfect fantasies. To be ripped back into a cold
  reality where you are dead and there is nothing I can do bout it, save
  joining you, is more than I can take.

  I love you, but you know that already, right? My heart is forever yours --
  you have ripped it out of my chest.
