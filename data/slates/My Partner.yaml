  Kreso keeps asking me, "why not hire a farmhand?" He means well, but he would never
  understand. I had a farmhand once -- really, they were more a partner than an employee --
  and I came to rely on them.

  Now that they are gone, I know I must never make that mistake again.

  They were the best worker I have ever seen. Never complained, never made mistakes, and
  shoveled groat shit with a smile. They made me look like an amateur every day.

  No one could ever hope to come close to their performance, so why bother. I would just be
  wasting my money if I hired another farmhand. I havce not hired an employee in years, and I
  have no plans to change that.
