  Last night I experienced the gretest of tortures; I dreamt of what life had been only a few
  weeks ago. I was surrounded by my friends and family, smiles on our faces as we shared a
  meal in our home. The dream felt so incredibly real, and I was a fool - I let myself get swept
  up in it, allowed myself to enjoy it.

  Then I woke up to endure another day in this nightmare.

  I pray that, wherever they are, the Great Serpent takes care of my dear husband, and my
  sweet daughter. I just wish I had the chance to say goodbye.
