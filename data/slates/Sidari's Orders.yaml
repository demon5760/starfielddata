  Sidari,

  The scouts are back and it seems like our luck ain't as bad as we
  thought. This ain't some random back of rock, there's a whole damn
  Va'ruun city here. They got food, water, ammo and all the supplies we
  need.

  Get some raiding parties together. Your toughest and meanest. No
  doubt these snake-lovers got weapons. Go out at night and start with
  the easy targets so as not to send up the alarm too quick. Essential
  supplies first, loot second.
