One of the challenges I found when looking for Starfield data on the Internet was that a lot
of the sites which had various bits of data in various formats but I couldn't seem to find 
any sites which exposed this information via any sort of API.

While I have put a simple UI on this site, everything is actually driven via data. In addition
to the pages on this site, the plan is to expose raw data files in few different formats, so
folks can build some automation/tooling on top of the data.
