One of the challenges I found when looking for Starfield data on the Internet was that a lot
of the sites were trying to monetize their content, so they only exposed information on some
rather heavy web pages. I couldn't seem to find any sites which exposed this information via
any sort of API.

While I have put a simple UI on this site, everything is actually driven via data. In addition
to the pages on this site, the plan is to expose raw data files in few different formats, so
folks can build some automation/tooling on top of the data.

In the near future, once I have accumulated a more complete data set I plan to provide a number
of links that can be used to grab the data powering the site.

## Systems
