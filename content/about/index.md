I've been playing Stafield recently, and I have found myself really enjoying outpost building.

The information here started in various text files and google sheets, but I figured others might
benefit from some of my notes, so I pulled this site together.

There are already plenty of other websites out there with guides and articles, and I don't look to
replace any of that. I really just wanted a way to organize and view some data in a way that makes
sense to me.
